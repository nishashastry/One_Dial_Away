# One Dial Away
An app designed to help a community of women feel safer in public settings.

## What it does ðŸ–¥
A female-identifying user signs up to a part of the One Dial Away community by entering their name and phone number. Then, anytime they feel uncomfrotablr in a specific location and need to escape the situation, they simple press the "call for help" button. This will trigger a phone call to their registered device with a prerecorded message mimicking an urgent request from a friend.

## How we built it ðŸ”¨
UX Design & Branding: We first created wireframes with Figma to map out an intuitive experience for users
Web Development: We used php, JavaScript, CSS, and the Twilio Programmable Voice API. The Twilio API allows us to generate outgoing calls to verified phone numbers.

## What we learned ðŸ“š
We learned how to implement the Twilio API and customize our outgoing phone call message to create a conversation simulation.

## What's next for One Dial Away
Geolocation: we hope to expand this idea to incorporating a geolocation feature, where the UX will display three buttons of increasing intensity. The lowest will trigger a conversation simulation, and the next button sending an alert to only One Dial Away members in the vicinity to asisst.The last button is an high intensity SOS button, calling 911. 

Location Reviews: A feature to display a map of alerts in the areas, as well as "review" in specific locations ot track and display how many alert calls have been made in that respective area

Mobile App: This ideally will be a mobile expierence

Machine Learning and AI: We hope to tailor the expierence of the calls using machine learning, to sense altertive in the users voice for signs of fear and adjust the conversation accordingly to help the user escape the situation.
